# Project-Inspect-analyze-NYC-Taxi-Data
The purpose of this project is to investigate and understand the data provided.

The goal is to use a DataFrame in Python, perform a cursory inspection of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission dataset, and inform team members of your findings.

Part 1: Understand the situation

Part 2: Understand the data

Part 3: Understand the variables

# Summary and Conclusions:
After looking at the dataset, the two variables most likely to help build a predictive model for taxi ride fares are total_amount and trip_distance because those variables show a picture of a taxi cab ride.
